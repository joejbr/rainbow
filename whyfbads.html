<h3>First of all, why Facebook Ads?</h3>

You want good patients to show up to your office, and you don’t want to overspend on advertising to get them.
<br>
If you make a million dollars but you spend $999k to make it, I don’t think that’s a good idea…
<br> 
Now let’s imagine you live in San Diego for example and you decided to promote your practice with billboard advertising, that will cost you between $11,000 to $23,000 per month.
<br>
So you might be thingking that you’re paying for all these people in these cars to see your advertisement.
<br>
But the truth is only a small 1%  are a potential customer.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/EmwJ6Gb.png">
</div>


This is true of all print, tv, radio and magazine advertising.
<br>
You pay for everyone to see your ad, regardless if they are likely to become a patient or not!
<br>
Essentially, it can really be a waste of money! With no good results.
<br>
<br>
Facebook Ads are different. You can actually choose who you show your ads to.
<br>
So if you target your ideal customer, then you only pay when your ideal customer sees your ad!
<br>
How awesome is that!
<br> 
<br>
What this means for results?
<br>
Since we are only showing our ads to our ideal customer,
<br>we are getting much more for our money.
<br>
We can spend very little, and get a lot in return.
<br>
Cool Fact: When running a campaign you’ll get leads with email, full name AND phone number as well!




<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Let's do some MATH!</h3>
Let's base this on your customer life time value (CLV/LTV) which is the prediction of the total worth of a patient to your business over the entirety of their relationship.
<br>
Let’s Say that we can only bring in 2 New Patients to your Office Every Month (We'll do more but stick with me).
<br>
Dental Patient LTV = $8000.
<br>
2 Patients x $8000 x 12 months = $192,000.
<br>
I'll charge you as a starter package $900 management fee + $300 ad spend that's $1200.
<br>
$1200 x 12 months = $14400
<br>
<br>
The Question is... as a business owner... would you invest $14,400 a year to put almost $200,000 of longterm revenue into your business over its lifetime?
<br>
ANSWER: I suppose you would want to do this year after year!
<br>
Another Good News: Advertising and Promotional Costs are Tax Deductible!





<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>So...</h3> 

I am moving into the dental market!
<br>
I know some people who have been extremely successful driving leads to Dental Offices with Facebook Ads!
<br>
And I am looking for a Great Dental Office to partner with.
<br>
<br>
Here’s what most dental marketing companies do; they just run your social media, they put up “pretty posts”, are any of those pretty posts really driving patients to your office? Or are they just entertaining your current existing audience?
<br>
At the end of the day, you always have to reverse engineer the psychology of the end-user, in this case your patient.
<br>
Facebook is sitting on an ungodly amount of data… The simple fact that you can target 30 to 40 years old moms is just mind blowing!...
<br>
More importantly, we're actually able to get in front of people based on their income level, how much money they make.
you're probably wondering how can Facebook know how much people make,
and the truth is that Facebook has partenered up with 3 of the largest data companies in the world,
and they provide that information to facebook, so everytime someone buys a car, a house or buys something with their credit card,
facebook knows that information and gives us the ability to get in front of people who can afford your services.
we want to target the right people, we dont just want to get anyone in the door,
so with the help of some cool tools by facebook and some sophisticatd backend system,
our abilty to put your ad in front of the right people who want your services and can afford them is mindblowing!

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>This is How it Works:</h3>
This is the landing page (Press Play):
<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0Rm1j7iBuE?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<br>

1) We run a targeted Facebook Ad to this Page.
<br>
2) If the person is interested, they put in their information.
<br>
3) On the next page we give them an incentive to call and book now.
<br>
4) We followup with them via text and email to call you.
<br>
5) Once they call your office, you'll hear a little message that lets you know they were sent from this page so you can track it.
<br>
6) Once they come in, you take them through your normal process and deliver what they signed up for... and Recommend anything else they need based on what you see (and they pay for that stuff).
 <br>
 <br>

 Would you be interested in running a test campaign to see how many people we could send to your office in the next few weeks?

<br>
<br>
I am trying to burst into the dental practice market with my Facebook Ads business!
<br>
So if you are interested or know anyone who owns a dental office let me know :)
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Much Love <3</b></h3>
